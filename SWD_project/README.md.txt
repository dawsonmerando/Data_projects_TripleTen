## Project Description

 - Machines and Fasteners have the highest return rate of all sub-categories.
 - Phones and Chairs have the highest sales with no returns with over 400,000 sales.
 - Technology has the highest return rate within the categories but following close behind is the other two.
 - We need to look into asking customers on why they are returning products. Some customers have a high return rate.
 - Utah, California, and Oregon have the highest return rate within the states.
 - August, September, and December are the highest return rate within all the months. Could be because of people going back to school.
 - The category with the highest return rate is technology in the month of September.
